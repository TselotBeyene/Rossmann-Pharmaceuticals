#Notebook: EDA Task 1 - Exploring Customer Purchasing Behavior

Overview

This Jupyter Notebook focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of customer purchasing behavior at Rossmann Pharmaceuticals. The objective is to uncover insights into how various factors, such as promotions and store characteristics, impact customer purchases.

Objectives

The primary goals of this analysis include:

Examining the distribution of promotions across the training and test datasets.

Analyzing sales patterns around holidays and festive seasons.

Identifying seasonal trends in customer purchases.

Exploring correlations between sales, customer counts, and other variables.

Evaluating the impact of promotions on both existing and new customers.

Assessing store performance with respect to opening and closing times.

Investigating the effects of competitor proximity on store sales.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The analysis includes a meticulous data cleaning process to ensure accuracy and reliability:

Identifying and addressing outliers.

Handling missing values systematically.

Standardizing data formats where necessary.

Visualizations

Visualizations play a crucial role in uncovering patterns and communicating findings effectively. The notebook leverages:

Histograms, bar plots, and line charts for trend analysis.

Heatmaps for visualizing correlations.

Comparative plots to highlight the impact of specific factors, such as promotions and holidays.

Logging and Traceability

The notebook incorporates Python's logging library to enhance reproducibility and traceability. Key actions and insights logged include:

Data loading and preprocessing steps.

Key assumptions and findings.

Outcomes of each analytical phase.

Key Questions Addressed

The analysis is driven by several strategic questions:

How do promotions influence sales across different stores?

Which stores gain the most from promotional campaigns?

How does competitor proximity affect sales trends?
